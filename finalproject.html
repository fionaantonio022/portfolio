            <p>
                Hi, I'm Princess Fiona Antonio, a passionate technology enthusiast currently taking a 
                Bachelor of Science in Technology at St. Dominic College of Asia. I enjoy exploring new 
                innovations, solving problems, and learning how technology shapes the future. In my free 
                time, I like practice my coding, designing, and experimenting with new software tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to become a skilled software developer, creating applications that make life easier 
                and more efficient. I aspire to work on innovative projects that enhance user experience and 
                contribute to technological advancements. I am eager to learn, grow, and collaborate with 
                like-minded professionals in the industry.
